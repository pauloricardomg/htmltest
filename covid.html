							<h2>ApacheCon COVID Policy<h2>
						</header>

<p>The COVID health policy for ApacheCon North America 2022 is as follows.</p>

<h3>Mask Mandate</h3>

<p><strong>While many municipalities’ mask mandates have been lifted, at this time masks will still be required to be worn at ApacheCon.</strong> <em>This is subject to change. Registered attendees will be notified two (2) months prior to the event of any updates to our mask mandate and other on-site health & safety requirements.</em></p>

<p>Masks must be worn over the nose and mouth and must be made of a tight-knit, non-permeable material. KN95 or N95 masks are recommended. Cloth masks are acceptable. Bandanas, scarves, and gaiters are not permitted to be used as masks.</p>

<p>Masks do not need to be worn when in outdoor spaces or while actively eating food and beverage indoors when socially distanced from others. Speakers are not required to wear masks while presenting.</p>

<h3>Vaccine Requirement</h3>

<p><strong>Attendees are required to be fully vaccinated</strong> against the COVID-19 virus. Fully vaccinated is defined as two weeks (14 full days) after the final dose (1 of 1, or 2 of 2) of a government-approved vaccine. ApacheCon is following this CDC definition of fully vaccinated for vaccination requirements, which at this time does not require but <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html">strongly recommends</a> boosters. We also encourage individuals who are eligible to receive the booster prior to attending any in-person Apache Software Foundation event.</p>

<p><em>We have no plans to remove the vaccine requirement for 2022 events. However, should there be a change in policy, it will be communicated to registered attendees via email at least two (2) months prior to the event.</em></p>

<h3>Accepted Vaccines</h3>

<p><strong>Only vaccines approved for emergency or full use by the World Health Organization fulfill our vaccine requirement.</strong> View the most up-to-date list of accepted vaccines <a href="https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/agency/who/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Vaccine Verification</h3>

<p><strong>Participants will need to show proof of vaccination and a government-issued photo ID to enter the event. The following are acceptable forms of proof of full vaccination:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Government-issued or government-compliant digital vaccination verification app (such as Clear or VaxYes)</li>
	<li>Physical (or digital photocopy of) COVID-19 vaccination card, record or certificate issued by a government agency, public health agency or other authorized vaccine provider (a photo will also suffice).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Daily Temperature and Symptom Checks</h3>

<p>At this time, we plan to have event participants receive a daily temperature and symptom check prior to entering the "event zone." This will only be required upon entry each day. A badge sticker will be provided after the check to allow for re-entry for the remainder of the day without additional checks.</p>

<h3>Wearable Indicators of Social Distance Comfort Levels</h3>

<p>AWe will provide a wearable indicator of social distance comfort levels for event participants to wear onsite (optional but encouraged). Participants are asked to be respectful of each other’s comfort level on social distance.</p>

<p>At a minimum, we will be following all mandated venue, municipality, and CDC guidelines. <strong>This list, and all protocols, are subject to change as the fluid COVID-19 situation changes.</strong></p>
